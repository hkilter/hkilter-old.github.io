I am currently working on a project, **SCOM** - *Ontological Supply Chain Management Model*,  which aims to create a dynamic model for tracking and tracing product/service, members, flow and operations of a supply chain with an upper ontology. 

It will hopefully let us to track any product/service and to trace its all physical, social or mental components (*raw materials, parts, know-how, patents, managerial strategy etc.*) efficiently. 

We may use outputs of this project in the future to track or trace almost all properties in a not-usual supply chain and operations management, such as interstellar supply chains (eg. raw materials from the planet Mars), health-related supply chains (*eg. blood products*), food management (*eg. genetic structures of agricultural products*), environmental issues of production systems (*eg. nuclear power usage in a production process*) and protection of art and artistic materials (*eg. tracing an artifact*).

You can find out more info about the SCOM project, as well as basic SCOM diagrams at [hkilter.com](http://hkilter.com/index.php?title=Research)

Best.
