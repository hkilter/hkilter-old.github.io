## Website Update

I have rearranged [Research](http://hkilter.com/index.php?title=Research) section of my website for the extensions of SCOM. There is a [SCOM Hub](http://hkilter.com/index.php?title=SCOM_Hub) right now. I have collected all stuff related to SCOM and put in this hub thingy.

Content of the hub is as:
- Ontological Supply Chain Management (SCOM)
- Supply Chain Markup Language (SCML)
- SCOM Examples
- SCOM Links
- SCOM Templates
- SCOM Terms
