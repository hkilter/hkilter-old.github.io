Conceptual view of fitness and fitness measurement of strategic decisions on information systems, technological systems and innovation are becoming more important in recent years. This paper determines some dynamics of fitness landscape which are lead to termination of decision makers' search before reaching the global maximum in strategic decisions. These dynamics are specified according to management decision making models and supported with simulation results. This article determines simulation results by means of Fitness Value and Probability of Optimality. Correlation between these two concepts may be remarkable according to revealing optimal values in innovative and research-based decision making approaches beside sub-optimal results of traditional decision making approaches.
